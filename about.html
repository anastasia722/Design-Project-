        <h2 id="h5">About this website</h2>
        <p id="p8">I am a teenaged girl that usually has no idea what to watch. I got this idea from my own personal experiences with diffuculties finding good tv shows to watch. 
            I asked a few friends if they had similar problems and we all agreed that this is a common issue. I decided to create this website to put an end to this reacuring problem. 
            My goal for this website is to help teens like myself find things to watch that isn't being scrolled on Tiktok. Speaking from experience, scrolling on tiktok is very easy and 
        I would like to help other teens find something better to do with their time. The tv shows listen on this website have great reviews and are well rated to entertain teenagers in my age group.</p>
