        <h2 id="h12">Here are a few reviws on the shows:</h2>
        <br> 
        <p id="p12"> B99: kittykatoncloud9- "COMFORT FOOD OF SHOWS: B99 is a rare gem among serial comedy duds. It's such a smart and fast-paced show that never fails to make me laugh, smile, and sometimes cry at very touching and human moments. This is a comfort show for me and I love rewatching for the running gags, callbacks to previous episodes, and to see the character development as they grow as people in ways that don't feel forced or contrived.
            The characters start out fairly rough and jagged with their own individual struggles but grow as a squad after the introduction of Capt. Holt. This is a feature, not a bug! The point of the show is that they're flawed!"

        <p id="p13"> Never Have I Ever: gouravecs- "ITS FUN AND SWEET -I watched all episodes in one go, it was a delightful experience."</p>
        <p id="p14"> TSITP: kelley1231-"WATCH IT FOR "JEREMIAH"
            Jeremiah is by far the best character of the series. Such a cute tween book to series adaptation. There's many layers and relationships from parents to children that everyone can connect with."</p>
         <p id="p15">Outer banks: DiCapriofan13- "WORTH WATCHING!
            I wasn't really sure what to expect from Outer Banks as I originally thought it was a show aimed just for teens but I couldn't of been more wrong. It's a show where people of all ages can enjoy it. It's about a teenager and his three best friends who hunt for a legendary hidden treasure after his father's disappearance. It takes a while to get going but once it does it doesn't slow down. There's something about this show that makes it feel authentic. It's a well enough written show where it will keep you following along and having a good time doing it. It has the perfect blend of comedy, drama, mystery, etc to keep you entertained. I really did enjoy it much more than I thought I would. If you're looking to turn off your mind and just enjoy a fun show...this is it!"</p>   
        <p id="p16">Modern Family: Supermanfan-13- "ONE OF THE BEST SITCOMS OF THE LAST DECADE
            Modern Family is one of the funniest sitcoms of the last decade. The entire cast is hilarious. It has one of the best ensemble casts of any show I can remember. Every single character shines and all the actors and actresses were perfectly cast for their roles. This went on for 11 amazing seasons, each one just as funny as the others. It never felt like the show was going stale or over staying it's welcome. Even watching the reruns will make you laugh like it's your first time seeing it. This show has won so many awards over the years and each one was earned. What makes this show so funny is that every family can relate to someone on the show, sometimes all of them. I would definitely recommend this show for anyone looking for a new sitcom."</p>
