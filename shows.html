        <h3 id="h7"> Brooklyn 99:</h3>
        <p id="p7"> "Brooklyn 99" is a comedy series staring NYPD detective Jake Peralta and various other detectives. This show is based on their lives through around 9 years on the force at the 99th Precinct. It covers many topics and runs through a point where COVID was present in their lives. If you enjoy a show ful of laughs and a bunch of action, "Brooklyn 99" is the one for you. </p>
        <h3 id="h8"> Modern Family:</h3>
        <p id="p18"> This show is another comedy following the lives of a huge family in Los Angeles. This show consists of 11 seasons of the lives of the Pritchets, Dunphys, Delgados and Tuckers. They went along to show us all the things happening with the family. This show is absolutely hilarious and I recommend it to someone looking for a long show to binge. </p>
        <h3 id="h9"> Outer Banks:</h3>
        <p id="p9"> The show follows a group of teenagers who are determined to find out what happened to the missing father of their friend, John B. During their adventure, they discover a treasure that is tied to John's father.</p>
        <h3 id="h10"> TSITP:</h3>
        <p id="p10"> "The summer I turned pretty" is about a love triangle between one girl (Belly) and two brothers (Conrad and Jeremiah). It is a story about first love, first heartbreak, and the magic of that one perfect summer. They know each other becuase their moms have been best friends for years. They have hung out every summer since birth and one summer, they all developped feelings for each other. This love triangle affected many people around them and the show is mainly bassed on them trying to figure out what to do.</p>
        <h3 id="h11"> Never have I ever:</h3>
        <p id="p11"> "Never have I ever" is about an Indian-American teen girl dealing with the sudden death of her father and the interesting journey through her last three years of high school. This is an amazing show if you want a short but sweet comedy show to watch in your free time.</p>
